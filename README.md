## Raspberry Pi App Store for Open Source Projects

There are many open-source, community-developed software projects for Raspberry Pi, yet very few people know about them. Pi-Apps aims to improve that, functioning as a software catalog and standardizing installation.

### To install Pi Apps:
```
git clone https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps
/home/pi/pi-apps/install
```
The install script ensures YAD is installed and creates a menu button. Nothing is modified outside your home directory.
### To run Pi Apps:
Menu -> Accessories -> Pi Apps, or type `./pi-apps/gui`.
