## Raspberry Pi App Store for Open Source Projects

There are many open-source, community-developed software projects for Raspberry Pi, yet very few people know about them. Pi-Apps aims to improve that, functioning as a software catalog and standardizing installation.

**Please note that Pi-Apps is very new and is a work in progress. It has not been officially released yet, and is not ready for regular users. That being said, if you are brave enough to try it, go ahead!**
**Also, please don't advertize Pi-Apps on public forums. It's not ready for prime time, may contain serious bugs, and Botspot has chosen to not release it yet.**

### To install Pi Apps:
```
git clone https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps
/home/pi/pi-apps/install
```
The install script ensures YAD is installed and creates a menu button. Nothing is modified outside your home directory.
### To run Pi Apps:
Menu -> Accessories -> Pi Apps, or type `./pi-apps/gui`.
