Unoffical launcher for Minecraft Bedrock edition

NOTE: For better performance and smooth FPS, we reccomend a version of bedrock like 1.16.40 as it doesn't contain renderdragon or RTX code.

Run with the menu app "Minecraft Bedrock Launcher" or with the command "GALLIUM_HUD=simple,fps /opt/MCBedrock.AppImage"
 ∙ Sign in with a Google Play account with Minecraft purchased
 ∙ Active comunity to ask for help
 ∙ FPS Counter mod
 ∙ And much more!
