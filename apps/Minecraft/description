Minecraft Java edition for the raspberry pi
To run: Menu -> Games -> Minecraft
To run in a terminal: java -jar /usr/share/minecraftjava/launcher.jar
This installs the old Minecraft launcher so that MC can be launched properly with any version and Optifine.

Botspot has configured the install script to create a custom launcher_profiles.json so you don't have to change settings manually.
NOTE: If you have any trouble with running Minecraft(not the launcher), then please directly follow this guide: https://www.noxxtech.tk/minecraft-install
