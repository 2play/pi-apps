Futuristic hacker terminal
Inspired from Hollywood, this terminal is beautiful to look at and to impress your friends. It's a fully-functional bash terminal, system monitor, and file manager, all in one fullscreen window.
To run the stable version: Menu -> System Tools -> eDEX-UI 2.2.2
To run the beta version: Menu -> System Tools -> eDEX-UI 3.0.0
Version 2.2.2 takes about 1 minute to load on a 2.1GHz Pi4, but version 3.0.0 takes almost 5 mins.
To exit eDEX-UI, run this command in the terminal window: exit
