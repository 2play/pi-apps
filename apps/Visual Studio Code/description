Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft.
Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git
It supports most popular coding languages including Python, JavaScript, and more.
Note: Visual Studio Code can be installed in Raspberry Pi OS via the default repositories  by running the command "sudo apt install code -y".
This should be done instead unless you're using a different OS other than Raspberry Pi OS (Full or Desktop) which doesn't have the repositories 
found in Raspberry Pi OS (http://archive.raspberrypi.org/ and http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/)
